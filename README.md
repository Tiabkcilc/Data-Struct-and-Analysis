# Data Structures and Algorithms Portfolio Submission

## Overview

This repository contains artifacts from two projects completed during my Data Structures and Algorithms course:

- **Project One:** Analysis of run-time and memory usage for different data structures (vector, hash table, binary search tree).
- **Project Two:** Working C++ code that sorts and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

These projects demonstrate practical application of algorithms, data structure design, and software development best practices.

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was to design and implement a software application that helps academic advisors access and organize course information for students. Specifically, the software needed to load course data from a file, store it efficiently using an appropriate data structure, and allow
